A wrapper script for the zram kernel module with interactive and init support.

This is a small helper script to setup a zram device as swap or as a ramdisk.
Also a zsh-completion file and openrc and systemd init-scripts are provided.

If zramctl (from >=util-linux-2.26) is available, this is used by default.
Currently, this is not a dependency: a manual method is provided as a fallback.
The latter might be removed in a future release of this script.

To install this script, just copy the content of sbin into root's $PATH.
To obtain support for zsh completion, copy the content of zsh to zsh's $fpath.
For openrc support, the content of openrc should go into /etc
For systemd support, the content of systemd/system should go into
/usr/lib/systemd/system or into /etc/systemd/system and be modified
(and enabled with systemctl enable ...) for the desired setting.
For systemd and optionally also for openrc the content of modprobe.d should go
into /lib/modprobe.d or /etc/modprobe.d and be modified appropriately.

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
