# size0, size1, ... are the variables for the sizes.

# The size is in megabytes.
# If the size is 0 (or empty) the device is ignored by the script.

# Available types:
# "swap"  The device is initialized as a swap device.
#         The flags variable specifies the priority (16383 if empty).
#         Use "-" in the flags variable to omit setting the priority.
# "/..."  The device is mounted on /...
#         The flags variable specifies the type (ext2 or ext4, default is ext4)
# Devices with other types are ignored by the script
